1. Project introduction/mission

Project Introduction
Island craft is a community-driven decentralized Gamefi2.0 aggregator that increases user engagement and entertainment through token incentives. We have created a new NFT+token economic system that nicely combines the best of DeFi and NFT, using financial mechanisms and game systems to empower users and developers

mission
"Now each meta-universe is like a small island in the ocean, we are still at the beginning of a great seafaring era, when technology and people's mints connect all these scattered islands to form a world of information and asset interoperability, it will certainly stimulate huge productivity creativity, then many new professions and business models will be born, we will be in the virtual world round after round We will feel the shock and subversion in the virtual world, and to some extent, the distance between people is closer and farther."

Every Metaverse is an island with values, and how to connect them is our main concern at this stage. Our vision is to build a truly developer-friendly, community-friendly ecosystem where gamefi and Defi converge, and to empower more creative projects to build a bridge between web2 and web3.

GameFi allows us to see a new and fairer business model where ownership of game virtual assets is returned to the players themselves with the addition of NFT, helping to solve the trust issues between game makers and players and driving the evolving business model of the gaming industry. The growth of the GameFi world does not seem to be slowing down anytime soon. With the influx of new investment and specific funding targeted at GameFi, the potential of space is limitless.

While there is an exciting future ahead, we observe the challenges faced by all stakeholders in this new gaming paradigm. First, each game is a separate ecosystem. There is no common authentication for each player's identity, achievements, interests, activities, or even community contributions.

1.4 Challenges
The above issues have different implications for different parties：

- For players: they cannot use their record to gain a favorable position in the initial NFT release (INO) or reward selection process, which largely limits the player's possibilities to profit. In addition, without a comprehensive Web3 identity (DID), the potential to improve one's gaming skills or adjust one's NFT portfolio is lost.

- For game studios: without a credible reputation system, the long-term sustainability and potential of a thriving ecosystem is undermined by uncontrolled market manipulation from giant whale users, deal hunters (scientists), and other undesirable elements. This inevitably shortens the life of the game and reduces user trust in the Web3 system as a whole.

- For guilds: today's gold playing options are manual, and without a standardized and proven system, this process would be inefficient and lead to high user attrition rates. In addition, without a mechanism for subsequent gold playing to reference past performance, players will not be motivated to maximize their potential.

- For the average player, they are often unable to make optimal decisions due to insufficient knowledge of market information. As far as the outcome of the game is concerned, careless decisions are the norm and most players are unable to maximize their benefits. Sometimes, the average player is also forced to get involved in a vicious competition between the project owner and the whales.


Island Craft's goal is to link together one island of value in Gamefi 2.0 and build it into a holistic, sustainable sea. 

Its protocol is automated through smart contract instructions, helps each user build a virtual identity through a DIDs identity system, and reaches consensus through DAO based on governance proposals and distributed network voting by token holders.


1.5 Actions
Island Craft's actions will include.
- Build a global community to serve investors, builders and players in the Gamefi space, bridging the barriers between different identities, roles and projects, and eventually aggregating and making self-running the community and its assets, resources and information system through a DAO organization

- Establish a complete decentralized identity authentication and identification system to build a better product and community by collecting user behavior to offer on-chain credentials to help Web3 builders, project owners and investors use credential data.

- Establish a complete virtual world economic system, linking each small island's economic system together through a series of innovative FT/NFT economic models to form a large economic system that maximizes individual benefits and allows each project owner or investor's asset stability to be guaranteed in this world


2. Tokenomics
As technology evolves and more and more people move their lives into virtual worlds, the entire digital economy is moving into a whole new virtual world, the so-called Metaverse, and Island Craft's business model is to build real-world value mapping from the basic metaverse economy.


2.1 Business Model
暂时无法在飞书文档外展示此内容

2.2 Business Model
Island Craft's primary revenue will be divided into three segments

- Direct or indirect use of NFT/FT assets owned by Island Craft to generate revenue through Defi's series of protocols, leases/pledges/liquidity mining, etc.

- Support more high-quality Gamefi2.0 projects to get more user resources and information resources, and grow together with the projects to gain revenue.

- NFT ownership will benefit from an increase in the economic value of in-game assets and be reflected in the value of native homogenized tokens (FTs) on the public market.


The value of all Island Craft activity will be reflected in the fully diluted market value of the DAOGO token governance.


2.3 Launch Plan

During the launch stage, the DAO will focus on the following games that have shown great potential and have strong community support.

● Millionaire (MOBA) by Doggo Metaverse.
● Big Dog Metaverse (Minecraft + Animal Cross), produced by Doggo Metaverse.
● Walk My Dog (X to Earn), supported by SIG (the largest investor in Bytedance
With the development of the Gamefi 2.0 model, Island Craft's portfolio will be expanded to include additional games that satisfy the criteria and revenue requirements outlined by the DAO.

2.4 Value Proposition

With the team's focus, the Island Craft team will work on the following.

● Attracting new players, investors, project parties, and contributors (including Mods, Solidity engineers, developers, economists, etc.).

● Incentivize participants through the "Level Up" rewards program, "Top Level" rewards program, leader acquisition, union events, tournaments, and voting participation.

● Distribution of token grants.

● Continuous version iterations and new features.

● Continuous building of the latest Defi products, including revenue aggregators, pledged return portfolios, NFT/FT leasing products, etc.

● Purchase of virtual game assets.



2.5 Creating Value

The value of Island Craft comes from the following.

● Revenues generated from virtual assets (NFT / FT) within the asset pool through Defi.
● % of APY token revenue generated from liquidity mining.
● assistance in managing and improving collaborative projects (economic model building / smart contract structuring).
● revenue generated from sponsorship/support activities (AMA / INO / IGO / Airdrop).
● Revenue generated from DAO's ongoing regular output of relevant research reports/articles, subscriptions.
● Revenue generated from NFT / FT sales.

Similar to the DAI or sUSD model, the 'over-collateralized stable coin' is directly linked to the DAOGO price. The core objective is to build a liquid medium with relatively stable coin value and absorb the fluctuations of the game's consumer coins by regulating the supply and consumption of this medium.

The generation of regulation coins requires pledging certain governance tokens and meeting certain "loyalty conditions" (such as pledging a certain amount of governance tokens or meeting a pledge period) before coins can be minted by way of overcollateralization, which can be used for trading rare assets in the NFT market, with the overcollateralization rate dynamically adjusted with the development of the economy. The core purpose is to absorb the volatility generated by periodic supply and demand imbalances within the game.

During the Genesis blind box sales phase, the price of the blind box increases with the number of units purchased according to the joint distribution curve, and 100% of the sales amount is used to build DAOGO's liquidity pool on uniswap
During the operation phase of the project, 1000 blind boxes will be issued in each phase according to the subscription method, and DAO organizations can vote to increase or decrease the number of blind boxes issued in each phase dynamically, and the number of subscriptions will be decided according to the number of stDAOGO held
3.1.2 NFT Secondary Market
Island Craft NFT Marketplace is a decentralized exchange for NFT where users can freely buy and sell NFT.

In order to provide the best user experience and lowest transaction fees, we have specifically optimized our smart contracts for NFT in the following ways

1) NFT can be traded directly within the smart contract. So users do not need to perform the operation of unlocking NFT before trading in the NFT market. This transaction method minimizes Gas transfer fees, thus giving users a low-cost experience of trading NFT assets.

2 ） The trading market has a packaged feature that allows users to choose to sell or buy multiple NFTs at once.

3 ） Island Craft platform charges a 5% transaction fee, the revenue will flow into the DAOT repurchase and destruction pool.

3.1.2.1 NFT lending
Some of the higher-rated NFTs use the ERC-4097 contract standard, which owners can use for leasing and earning interest

3.1.3 NFT Creator labs
NFT Creator is a platform for artists and designers to create their own unique NFTs that can be used in all Island Craft games. By removing technical barriers such as the need to understand smart contracts and NFT distribution, Island Craft makes the entire NFT creation process as easy as possible, providing users with all the tools they need to create NFTs and help them reap the rewards of NFT creation.

3.1.4 WEB3 products publisher
The platform provides both an economic model and dapp support for indie game developers

The Island Craft platform will provide developers with access to Island Craft NFT or customize it to assist project parties in distributing NFT

The Island Craft platform will provide project ownership access to DAOGO / DAOT / STDAOGO tokens and customize the game's economic system and economic model for project owners

Island Craft platform will help to do smart contract deployment and game data and game assets on the chain for project parties

3.2 DEX
3.2.1 Liquidity Pool
Each revenue aggregator's strategy is a smart contract that automatically optimizes and provides users with the best liquidity mining revenue strategy on the Coin Security Smartchain (BSC). Users can deposit their stable coins or specific liquidity tokens (LPs) into the revenue aggregator's smart contract. Each revenue aggregator has their unique strategy that will optimize liquidity mining through different DeFi protocols.

3.2.2 Yield Aggregator
In order to provide the best returns to liquidity providers, island craft yield aggregators are smart contracts that integrate a series of optimized liquidity mining strategies that automatically seek the best yield strategy for users. The platform currently supports 2 single-currency mining strategies and 3 LP token mining strategies.

Project side: Gamefi or web2 game project team
DAO consulting team: Island Craft core contributors
Investors: looking for new game projects and investment projects, primary and secondary investors
Players: platform project game experience players


A player in a game will also be a secondary market investor in the Gamefi, and that player can also play a role as a member of the DAO's consulting team, contributing to its platform or projects on the platform.

4.1.2 Soul Bonding Token

OAT (On-chain Achievement Pass), an electronic badge in ERC721 format, is simply an NFT like POAP. this tool is geared towards event organizers and community managers, and it plays the role of distributing event incentives and enhancing event participation. it is meant to provide a flexible infrastructure for communities, on which any community can distribute NFTs on its own, in a conveniently distribute commemorative NFTs, greatly lowering the threshold for communities to distribute incentive-based NFTs.

4.1.3 Vote
[图片]
The DAO construction team or coin holders can initiate proposals according to certain rules, and the proposals will be passed into the proposal pool and start voting, and the voting will be executed by the DAO construction team, and the proposals are divided into two categories: governance proposals and incubation proposals.

4.1.3.1 Governance Proposal


Governance proposals and ballots will include, but are not limited to, the following topics.
1. technology
2. products and projects
3. token allocation
4. governance structure

Any member of the community on Island Craft can send proposals through the website for the ecosystem to vote on. Decisions will be made based on a majority vote and implemented through a distributed system. Tokens can be awarded as rewards to those community members who ultimately win the proposal.

Proposal rights: Doggo NFT holders have proposal rights and are limited to the first 50 Daoggo NFT holders

Voting rights: stDAOGO can be obtained by pledging DAOGO and stDAOGO / Soul Points holders have voting rights.


Knowledge-extractable Voting (KEV)
Proposals will be divided into different topics, and different topics will correspond to different Knowledge Passes, and having a certain type of Knowledge Pass can give more votes in the proposals of that type of topic.

If the votes cast match the final voting result, users will be rewarded with more Knowledge Passes of the corresponding topic, and vice versa, their Knowledge Passes will be deducted.



4.1.3.2 Incubation proposals
Island Craft will create multiple SubDAOs for hosting specific game assets and activities. assets in the SubDAOs are acquired, fully owned, and controlled by Island Craft through multi-signature hardware wallets. The SubDAO is tokenized and a portion of the SubDAO tokens will be made available to the community. Community SubDAO token holders are able to propose and vote on specific game mechanics. The goal is to incentivize the community to put the assets under the management of the finance department to work. Community SubDAO token holders are able to enjoy the potential upside of the assets and the revenue generated in productive games 

Proposal rights: Soul-bound tokens that meet certain conditions have the right to propose projects in the pool for incubation

Voting rights: pledged DAOGO to get stDAOGO, stDAOGO / Soul Points holders have voting rights

Weighted Voting & Reputation-based Voting
The DAO organization makes the voting utility linked to the length of the holding time, the longer the holding time, the greater the voting power. The voting utility is also linked to the length of the locked position, users can choose not to lock the position, but the voting utility is extremely small, and choosing a longer lock length can increase the voting utility.
[图片]

Soul Points, a non-transferable, non-circulating score, may be earned by holding or locking up passes, but it is reputation, not passes, that have voting power. Soul Points can also be earned by contributing to the organization. Soul Points holders do not have absolute ownership of Soul Points, and earned Soul Points may be destroyed by code rules or by governance vote.

4.1.4 Build
Task pool allocation

4.1.5 Invest
Investing in DAOGO gives you certain proposal and governance rights.

4.1.6 Service

4.1.7 DAO distribution
1. Pledge proceeds of 15% of the total supply of governance tokens to support long-term supporters of the DAO ecosystem;

2. a single-coin pledge of governance tokens that will receive a certain APY return for a locked-in fixed period.

3. LP liquidity pledge, with APY and release adjusted on a quarterly basis (decided by member vote).

4. DAOGO non-locked pledge to obtain community voting rights, which will have voting governance incentives.

5. an NFT pledge to gain community voting governance rights, which would have a voting governance incentive.
