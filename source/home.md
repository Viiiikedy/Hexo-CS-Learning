👋Hello everyone.  
🌐This [site](#note) is created by me,one university student🎓to record the CS learning. 

🌊The initial intention of starting this department website was to feel that the knowledge around me was really scattered. Every time I wanted to obtain a professional answer, I had to spend a lot of time searching for information, judging and filtering the correctness of the information, and further searching through the waves of information. I did not truly and systematically form my own knowledge system, so I started this journey

⚠️This site shouldn't be used for business purpose.

## Content
😃I will share the 1️⃣notes,completed 2️⃣projects,the 3️⃣interview tutorial and other related 4️⃣posts when I learn Computer Science here.
💕My major in the university isn't computer sience.However it doesn't stop my passion to learn.So I hope this smal site could become your power to concistently walk on your own way.

☀️Wish you guys a good day today.
