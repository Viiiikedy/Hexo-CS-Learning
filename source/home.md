## Preview 概览 
👋Hello everyone.  
🌐This site is created by me,one university student 🎓to record the CS learning. 

🌊The initial intention of starting this department website was to feel that the knowledge around me was really scattered. Every time I wanted to obtain a professional answer, I had to spend a lot of time searching for information, judging and filtering the correctness of the information, and further searching through the waves of information. I did not truly and systematically form my own knowledge system, so I started this journey

⚠️This site shouldn't be used for business purpose.


👋大家好.  大家好 
🌐这个[网站](#note)主要是我，某大学生🎓记录学习计算机所用.  

🌊开始做这个系类网站的初心就是觉得身边的知识真的太零散了，每次我想要获得一个专业的回答都要花费很多时间在找资料、判断和筛选资料的正确性以及进一步在资料中大浪淘沙当中，没有真正体系化地形成自己的知识系统，所以就开始了这趟旅程. 

⚠️这个网站不能被任何途径商用哦.
